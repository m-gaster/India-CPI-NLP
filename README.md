# India-CPI-NLP

Code used to wrangle, categorize, and clean CPI data collected in India as part of Nadhanael GV's PhD thesis. 

Unfortunately, my algorithms only delivered accuracy in the mid 80%'s, whereas the supervisors required accuracy in the high 90%'s, so the data was hand-processed in the end.

My first major project (not well written/organized).
